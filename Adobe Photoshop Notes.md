Note that with HackMD the workspace filename and the github filename are not necessarily the same. A file can be pulled from github and given a different name in a workspace.

Also note that you only get 20 github pushes unless you upgrade HackMD. This is a serious limitation. The minimum premium cost for one user is USD5 per month billed annually.

Seems like I would be better off just using Visual Studio Code linked directly to github.
