#Overview
Note that with HackMD you only get 20 github pushes unless you upgrade HackMD. This is a serious limitation. The minimum premium cost for one user is USD5 per month billed annually.
Seems like I would be better off just using Visual Studio Code linked directly to github.
Also editing with github.dev loads Visual Source Code into the browser and integrates directly with the github repository. This seems to be a better option than HackMD.

Note that with HackMD the workspace filename and the github filename are not necessarily the same. A file can be pulled from github and given a different name in a workspace.
